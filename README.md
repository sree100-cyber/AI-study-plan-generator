# 📌 Project Overview

The AI Study Plan Generator is a smart web application that helps students plan their studies efficiently by automatically generating a personalized study schedule.
Instead of manually tracking deadlines and free time, the system analyzes user inputs and suggests optimized study timings using AI-based logic.

This project aims to reduce stress, improve time management, and ensure timely task completion.

# 🎯 Objectives

To help students manage study time effectively

To automate study scheduling based on availability

To reduce manual planning errors

To improve productivity and consistency in studying

# 🧠 Key Features
